# ATM System - First Year C Programming Project

This is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system written in C as a first-year programming project, developed together with my groupmates.

## Features

- Account login (with account number, name, and PIN)
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Check account balance
- Basic error handling and validation

## How to Run

1. Compile the code with a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. Run the resulting executable in a Windows environment (uses `conio.h` and `system("cls")`).
